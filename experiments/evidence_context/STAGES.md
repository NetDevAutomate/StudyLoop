# Independently runnable learning stages

Run commands from the experimental worktree root. Each stage has an immutable Git
checkpoint so later changes cannot silently change the version you are studying.
These are local commits: preserving the repository preserves the checkpoints;
no remote publication or backup is implied.

| Stage | Question | Checkpoint | Entry point and guide |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — Evidence retrieval | Can reviewed relationships add relevant evidence while preserving citations and bounds? | `c262c08` | `python -m experiments.evidence_context`; README.md and ARBITRATION.md |
| 2 — Shared context requirements | What must StudyLoop and a standalone consumer both guarantee? | `46442cb` | `tests/test_shared_context_requirements.py`; REQUIREMENTS.md. This is an executable contract stage, not a separate visual demo. |
| 3 — Correction and forgetting | Can offline replicas converge without resurrecting forgotten content? | `b44145a` | `python -m experiments.evidence_context.lifecycle_demo`; STUDY-GUIDE.md |
| 4 — Capture health | Does configured capture actually yield recent history? | `ae2b250` | `python -m experiments.evidence_context.capture_health`; capture_health/GUIDE.md and COUNCIL-DECISION.md |

Stage 3 uses its own lifecycle adapter and database schema. It does not modify the
stage 1 evidence store, and does not require stage 1 demo output. Stage 2 uses
stage 1 fixtures/code; its pinned checkpoint contains everything needed to run it.
All examples below create temporary/synthetic data only. Use a new output path
for every demo run; existing directories are deliberately not overwritten.

## Run from the current worktree

```sh
# Stage 1: keyword and reviewed-relationship retrieval
uv run python -m experiments.evidence_context --output /tmp/evidence-stage-1
uv run --group dev pytest experiments/evidence_context/tests/test_evidence_contract.py experiments/evidence_context/tests/test_snapshot_and_cli.py -q

# Stage 2: whole-pack scope boundaries and grounded explanations
uv run --group dev pytest experiments/evidence_context/tests/test_shared_context_requirements.py -q

# Stage 3: correction, offline deletion and stale replay
uv run python -m experiments.evidence_context.lifecycle_demo --output /tmp/evidence-stage-3
uv run --group dev pytest experiments/evidence_context/tests/test_lifecycle.py -q
```

Current-tree commands run the current implementation. For the exact historical
behaviour, use a checkpoint worktree instead.

## Freeze a stage without switching your working branch

From a checkout of this Git repository, choose one new directory:

```sh
git worktree add --detach /tmp/studyloop-evidence-stage-1 c262c08
cd /tmp/studyloop-evidence-stage-1
uv sync --all-packages --group dev
uv run python -m experiments.evidence_context --output /tmp/evidence-stage-1-frozen
```

Substitute `46442cb` or `b44145a` and a different directory for stages 2 or 3,
then run that stage's command above. A detached worktree is suitable for inspection;
create a branch there before making changes you want to keep. Dependency fetching
may need network access; the tests and demos do not call model providers.

## Convention for every following stage

- Keep prior entry points and demos working. Use a separate module/directory and
  disposable schema where a new design has different semantics.
- Record a completion commit here, plus exact setup, demo and test commands.
- Include a guide explaining the problem, alternatives, why we chose one, costs,
  observed results and what remains unproven. Include expected demo observations.
- Distinguish a contract-test stage from a user-facing demonstration. Never imply
  that a synthetic adapter validates an installed integration.
- Preserve synthetic fixtures; keep real transcripts and provider outputs private.
- Keep council advice, coordinator decisions and test evidence distinguishable.

## Stage 4 commands

```sh
uv run python -m experiments.evidence_context.capture_health --output /tmp/evidence-stage-4
uv run --group dev pytest experiments/evidence_context/tests/test_capture_health.py -q
```

Checkpoint `ae2b250` can be opened in a detached worktree using the same procedure.
The council reconsidered the order using all four stages' evidence. See
[capture_health/COUNCIL-DECISION.md](capture_health/COUNCIL-DECISION.md).

## Revised planned stages — not implemented

5. Held-out retrieval-value evaluation before more integration: frozen local
   questions/labels, keyword and relationships, shuffled-link control, explicit
   missing-evidence cases, matched budgets and measured costs. No efficacy claims
   from synthetic scaffolding or previously explored development cases.
6. Use those results and a further council review to choose lifecycle-to-evidence
   integration versus installed-package ownership tests. Both remain required
   before production; neither is silently considered complete.
7. Engine comparison only if measurements justify it. Capture health still needs
   live detection and coverage watermarks before it can substantiate real history.

The stage-4 council reviewed cross-stage results and stage-4 source. A full diverse
implementation review of stage 3 remains outstanding before promotion.
