## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Activation is readiness-gated on every entry path
Every Web API path that can leave a study plan in the `active` state SHALL
delegate to `PlanApplication.apply` and SHALL be refused by the seam's single
readiness gate when the *resulting* document has no mission `why`, no success
criteria, or no milestones. The routes in `web/routes/plans.py` SHALL hold no
readiness check of their own (`rg 'readiness\(' web/routes/plans.py` → 0 hits).
A refusal SHALL be `422` with the body
`{"message": "plan is not ready to activate", "plan_id", "ready": false,
"blockers": [...], "nudges": [...]}` — the same body the `PATCH` status path
has always returned — and SHALL persist nothing: no document is created,
replaced or re-saved before the gate runs.

#### Scenario: Create with status active on an unready plan
- **WHEN** `POST /api/plans` is called with `{"title": "Vague", "status": "active", "answers": {}}`
- **THEN** the response is `422` whose `detail.ready` is `false` and
  `detail.blockers` is non-empty, no document is written, and
  `GET /api/plans?status=active` reports `count == 0`

#### Scenario: Whole-document replacement whose frontmatter says active
- **WHEN** `PATCH /api/plans/{id}` is called with `{"markdown": ...}` where the
  document's frontmatter has `status: active` and the Milestones section is
  empty
- **THEN** the response is `422` with `detail.ready == false`, and the stored
  document is byte-identical to what it was before the request (status still
  `draft`, milestone count unchanged)

#### Scenario: Status transition to active on an unready plan
- **WHEN** `PATCH /api/plans/{id}` is called with `{"status": "active"}` on a
  plan whose readiness reports blockers
- **THEN** the response is `422` with `detail.ready == false`, and
  `GET /api/plans/{id}` still reports `status == "draft"`

#### Scenario: Raw-markdown import whose frontmatter says active
- **WHEN** `POST /api/plans` is called with `{"markdown": ...}` whose
  frontmatter has `status: active` and which has no milestones
- **THEN** the response is `422` with `detail.ready == false` and no document
  is written

#### Scenario: Every door returns the same refusal
- **WHEN** the same unready document is refused via create-with-status, status
  transition, document replacement and raw-markdown import
- **THEN** the four `422` bodies are equal apart from `plan_id`, with the same
  blockers and nudges in the same order

#### Scenario: A ready plan still activates on every door
- **WHEN** a plan with a mission `why`, at least one success criterion and at
  least one milestone is created with `status: active`, or transitioned to
  `active`, or replaced by a document whose frontmatter says `active`
- **THEN** the response is `201` (create) or `200` (patch) and the plan's
  `status` is `active`; several plans MAY be active at once

### Requirement: Plan routes map seam errors to HTTP status codes in one place
`web/routes/plans.py` SHALL translate `PlanError` subclasses exactly once:
`PlanNotFound` → `404`, `InvalidPlanId` and `InvalidField` → `400`,
`PlanConflict` → `409`, `PlanNotReady` → `422` (body above),
`InvalidMilestone` → `404`. Response bodies for list, detail, create, patch and
interview SHALL be unchanged from the pre-seam routes: summaries carry the
`StudyPlan.summary()` key set and readiness blocks carry the
`authoring.readiness()` key set.

#### Scenario: Duplicate id without overwrite
- **WHEN** `POST /api/plans` names a `plan_id` that already exists and does
  not set `"overwrite": true`
- **THEN** the response is `409` and the existing plan is unchanged

#### Scenario: Unknown plan on a write
- **WHEN** `PATCH /api/plans/{id}` is called for an id with no document
- **THEN** the response is `404` before any field of the body is validated
